# Firefox Flux

A CSS theme that blends itself into the page without sacrificing function. 

Intended to be used with [Adaptive Tab Bar Colour extension]https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/adaptive-tab-bar-colour/ ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/easonwong-de/Adaptive-Tab-Bar-Colour)). Flux is a "oneliner" theme, its focus is to be invisible by removing a lot of toolbar bloat and leaving an interface that can almost dissapear into the page. Flux tries to achieve a balance between keyboard-based operation and mouse-based operation. It removes a lot of toolbar bloat that causes slow mouse searching and by that nature it promotes more efficient methods. Some mouse controls are still vital and efficient. Flux is designed to be aesthetically minimalist and pleasing but such that no functionality and no speed is lost in the process.

This project extends work done by [Bali10050](https://github.com/Bali10050/FirefoxCSS) and features a lot of code taken from [MrOtherGuy](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/firefox-csshacks). Icons are taken from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) icon library.
