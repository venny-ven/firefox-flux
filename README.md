# Firefox Flux

Flux is a oneliner-style theme implemented as a CSS mod that you can apply to your browser in just two minutes. The focus of Flux is to appear almost invisible or as if integrated into the page by removing a lot of toolbar bloat and by leveraging dynamic interface features, all while remaining highly practical and efficient. Declogging the interface naturally promotes more keyboard-based operation, however I try to achieve a balance between this and mouse operation, since many mouse actions are undeniably more effective and more sensible. Flux is designed to be aesthetically minimalist and pleasing but such that no functionality and no speed is lost in the process.

This project extends work done by [Bali10050](https://github.com/Bali10050/FirefoxCSS) and features a lot of code taken from [MrOtherGuy](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/firefox-csshacks). Icons are taken from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) icon library.

### Features

**It is strongly recommended to use [Adaptive Tab Bar Colour extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/adaptive-tab-bar-colour/) with this theme. Flux was designed specifically for it and will look much better.**

- "Oneliner" toolbar that houses both URL navigation and tabs
- No rim around URL bar for more integrated within-the-page appearance
- No silly rainbow gamer colors on the interface
- Buttons on the toolbar are animated into view when the toolbar is hovered, keeping the area pristine during most operations
- No redundant elements and controls on the bar
	- Middle-click empty space on the bar to open a tab. No + button
	- Middle-click on the tab to close it. No x button
	- Side-buttons on the mouse to move forward and backward through page history. No `<-` `->` buttons
- Fresh thematically fitting icons for new tab and for sites that don't have an icon
- Animated icon for loading pages instead of a static hour glass
- Oneliner style new tab content with a more oomphy Firefox logo
- Restyled private window
- Bug-free flawless operation comes before aesthetics
